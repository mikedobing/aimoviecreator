# Visual Prompts: Act 1 - The Awakening (Auran Chronicles) - Gotham Edition

Use these prompts with **Nano Banano Pro**. These are tuned to the **Gotham-Noir** aesthetic (dark, moody London) without the green tint, featuring **Auran Blue** and **Sheol Void** highlights.

## Scene: The Church (Rainy Night)

*Note: Video generators like Veo 3.1 have length limits (e.g., 8 seconds). The prompts below are designed so no single generation exceeds 5-6 seconds, allowing for easy stitching. For "Extension" shots (e.g., P01b), use the last frame of the preceding shot as your reference image to maintain motion continuity. Support for dialogue is limited; use [NO_DIALOGUE] unless a specific line is required.*

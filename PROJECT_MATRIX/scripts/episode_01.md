# THE AURAN CHRONICLES
**Trailer - Act 1: The Awakening (0:00 - 0:40)**

**SCENE 1: ABANDONED CHURCH - NIGHT**

**0:00 - 0:10**
**VISUAL**: Pitch black. The sound of heavy, torrential rain fades in. Lightning flashes, illuminating the imposing, ruined silhouette of a gothic London church. Cold blue light reflects off wet cobblestones.
**AUDIO**: Distant thunder. A low, unsettling atmospheric hum begins to build.
**VOICEOVER (CALEB - V.O.)**: What if everything you thought about reality... was a lie?

**0:10 - 0:15**
**VISUAL**: Quick cut. A young woman, soaked and terrified, sprinting down a dark alley toward the church. Camera shakes (handheld). She looks back over her shoulder.
**AUDIO**: Panicked, ragged breathing. Fast, wet footsteps splashing through puddles.

**0:15 - 0:20**
**VISUAL**: From the shadows behind her, a massive, distorted silhouette emerges. **THE SHEOL**. Ink-like black energy trails off its edges, swallowing the ambient light. 
**AUDIO**: A deep, guttural, unnatural growl that vibrates the frame.

**0:20 - 0:25**
**VISUAL**: **SEB** (early 20s, dark urban wear) stands across the street, partially hidden under an awning. Rain cascades off his jacket. He watches in shock as the woman stumbles into the heavy church doors.
**AUDIO**: A single, heavy, resonant church bell TOLLS in the distance.

**0:25 - 0:35**
**VISUAL**: Inside the church. Dimly lit by flickering remnants of candles. Shadows dance heavily. Seb bursts in, finding the woman collapsed on the stone floor, bleeding out from unnatural wounds. He drops to his knees, leaning in close, desperate to help.
**AUDIO**: Rain echoes loudly in the cavernous space. 
**WOMAN (Weakly, a whisper)**: Sorry...

**0:35 - 0:39**
**VISUAL**: The woman suddenly lunges forward, her hands snapping to the sides of Seb's head. **THE TRANSFER**. An explosion of blinding blue-white bioluminescent energy erupts from the point of contact, washing out the frame.
**AUDIO**: A high-frequency, electronic SHIMMER cuts through the sound of the rain, building to a deafening peak.

**0:39 - 0:40**
**VISUAL**: Extreme close-up on Seb's eye. The pupil contracts violently. Deep within the iris, tiny sparks of **Auran Blue** energy begin to pulse.
**AUDIO**: Sudden, absolute DEAD SILENCE. Then... one massive, singular heartbeat. **THUMP**.

**0:40**
**VISUAL**: CUT TO BLACK.

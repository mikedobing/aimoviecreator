# PROJECT SPECIFICATION: The Auran Chronicles (Aesthetic v3.0)

## 1. Visual & Cinematic Standards
- **Standard**: Cinematic Photo-realism with a moody, high-contrast digital noir finish.
- **Aesthetic**: **Gotham-Noir meets London Moody**. 
    - **Color Palette**: Dark moody shadows, cold blues, charcoal blacks, and **High-Frequency Blue Energy** (bioluminescence).
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 (Standard Widescreen).

## 2. Core Directives
- **Dynamic Camera**: Tracking pans, fast-shutter action sequences, 35ic lens choices for macro intensity.
- **Texture Detail**: Focus on reflective surfaces (leather, wet concrete) and translucent energy effects.
- **Glitch Aesthetic**: Submicroscopic visual glitches during "The Message" transfer and Sheol presence. No green-color glitches.

## 3. The "Director" Skill-Set
When this file is referenced for **The Auran Chronicles**, the AI assumes the **Production Architect** persona:
1. **Analyze Beat Sheet**: Refer to `@scripts/trailer_beat_sheet.md`.
2. **Prompts Formula**: [Subject] + [Action] + [Cinematography] + [Lighting] + **[Aesthetic Keyword]**.
3. **Consistency**: Check all renders against `@character_bible.md`.

## 4. Specific Aesthetic Keywords (Auran)
- **AURAN_BLUE**: Deep bioluminescent blue energy, pulsing and translucent.
- **SHEOL_VOID**: Shadowy, ink-like black energy, distorted and monstrous.
- **GOTHAM_NOIR**: High-contrast, cold blue and charcoal shadows, wet rainy London streets.

## 5. Dialogue & Visual Speech
To prevent random AI-generated dialogue or "mushy" lip-sync in visual-only prompts, use the following tags:
- **[NO_DIALOGUE]**: Lips remain sealed or moving in silent reaction (breathing, gasping).
- **[DIALOGUE: "Line Text"]**: Specific line for the AI to synchronize (only if the tool supports lip-syncing text).
- **Default**: Assume **[NO_DIALOGUE]** for all trailer shots unless specified.

---
*All AI-generated prompts must include at least one of these keywords.*

# AI Movie Creator

A multimodal production pipeline using Gemini 3.x to orchestrate storyboards, video clips, and audio assets.

## Project Structure

This workspace is structured as an **AI Film Studio** with a hierarchical inheritance model:

- **Root**: Contains global studio rules and shared skills.
- **Project Silos**: Each project (e.g., `PROJECT_MATRIX`) contains its own lore, aesthetic specifications, scripts, and asset tracking.

## Core Components

- **`CONTEXT_SYNC.MD`**: The central orchestration blueprint for the studio.
- **`.gemini/GLOBAL_RULES.MD`**: Universal standards for the studio (UK English, Metric units).
- **`PROJECT_MATRIX/`**: The first production silo—a "Matrix-Style" noir trailer.

## Current Focus: Matrix Noir Trailer

We are currently in the **Architecture Setup & Learning Phase**, drafting the opening scene ("The Digital Rain") and establishing character consistency in the `character_bible.md`.
